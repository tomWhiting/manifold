# Next Session: Pivot to Phase 2 - Memtable Layer

**Date:** 2025-01-29  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete but Not Applicable ‚ö†Ô∏è - Need Different Approach  
**Goal:** Implement write buffer layer (memtable-like) for true performance gains

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. Performance Analysis ‚úÖ
- **Current Performance:** Manifold ~750K ops/sec vs RocksDB ~5M ops/sec (6.7x gap)
- Verified per-CF storage architecture is already optimal (each CF has independent write buffer)
- Tested performance extensively - consistent results across multiple runs

### 2. RocksDB Source Code Analysis ‚úÖ
- Cloned and analyzed RocksDB implementation (`/tmp/rocksdb/`)
- Discovered their pipelined write architecture:
  - `WriteThread` with multi-stage coordination
  - Async WAL sync separate from memtable writes
  - Parallel memtable writers
- Key insight: **Separate WAL fsync from commit path** for better batching

### 3. Implemented AsyncWALJournal ‚úÖ (But Won't Help) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **File:** `src/column_family/wal/async_journal.rs` (506 lines)
- **Features:**
  - Background sync thread with automatic fsync batching
  - Non-blocking `append()` - transactions return immediately
  - Efficient `wait_for_sync()` with 10Œºs spin-wait
  - Configurable polling (100Œºs) and max delay (1ms)
- **Tests:** 5 unit tests, all passing
- **Helper:** Added `read_entries_from_backend()` to sync WALJournal

### 4. CRITICAL DISCOVERY ‚ö†Ô∏è
**AsyncWAL won't improve this benchmark** because:
- Benchmark uses **synchronous commits** - each must complete before next
- `txn.commit()` MUST wait for fsync to ensure durability
- AsyncWAL helps async/fire-and-forget workloads, not blocking commits
- Threads still call `wait_for_sync()` and block

**The Real Bottleneck:**
- Writes go directly to B-tree pages (random I/O, page allocations)
- Need **memtable-like layer** where writes go to memory first
- Background thread flushes to B-tree periodically
- This is RocksDB's architecture - and why they're 6.7x faster

### 4. Created Comprehensive Design Document ‚úÖ
- **File:** `docs/wal_pipelining_design.md`
- 3-phase roadmap with detailed architecture
- Progress tracking for session continuity
- Expected improvements documented

---

## Next Steps (Revised Strategy)

### ‚ùå Phase 1 (AsyncWAL) - SKIP Integration
**Decision:** Don't integrate AsyncWALJournal - it won't help this workload.
- Code is complete and tested (506 lines)
- Could be useful for future async/streaming workloads
- But wrong optimization for current synchronous commit pattern

### ‚úÖ NEW APPROACH: Phase 2/3 - Write Buffer Layer

Implement a memtable-like layer (RocksDB's secret sauce):

**Architecture:**
```rust
Writes ‚Üí WriteBuffer (in-memory HashMap/SkipList) ‚Üí Background flush ‚Üí B-tree
Reads  ‚Üí Check WriteBuffer first ‚Üí Then B-tree
WAL    ‚Üí Protects WriteBuffer (already have this)
```

**Why This Will Work:**
1. **Writes become memory-only** - no B-tree page allocations during commit
2. **Background thread batches B-tree updates** - amortizes random I/O cost
3. **Natural fit with WAL** - write buffer is durable via WAL
4. **This is what RocksDB does** - memtable + SSTable architecture

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create WriteBufferLayer struct** (1-2 days)
   - In-memory SkipMap or HashMap for active writes
   - Immutable buffer being flushed
   - Background flush thread
   - Size-based flush triggers

2. **Update transaction path** (1 day)
   - Writes go to write buffer instead of B-tree directly
   - Reads check write buffer first (like page cache)
   - Commit just appends to WAL + updates buffer

3. **Background flush** (1 day)
   - Periodically or on size threshold
   - Batch write buffer contents to B-tree
   - Single transaction for whole batch

4. **Testing & Benchmarking** (1 day)
   - Ensure correctness with concurrent reads/writes
   - Run cf_comparison_benchmark
   - Target: 3-4M ops/sec (close to RocksDB)

**Expected Improvement:**
- Current: 750K ops/sec
- With write buffer: 3-5M ops/sec (4-7x improvement)
- Could match or exceed RocksDB!

- `src/column_family/wal/async_journal.rs` - Unit tests (lines 410-506)

### Documentation

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/tom/Developer/spaces/projects/hyperspatial/main/redb

# Check current status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Read the design doc
cat docs/wal_pipelining_design.md

# Run tests
cargo test async_journal

# Run benchmark (current baseline)
cargo bench --package manifold-bench --bench cf_comparison_benchmark
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Async WAL over lock-free queue** - Simpler, sufficient for our needs
2. **Spin-wait over park/unpark** - Lower latency for wait_for_sync()
3. **BTreeSet for pending queue** - Efficient range queries for max sequence
4. **100Œºs poll interval** - Balance between latency and CPU usage
5. **Phase 1 then Phase 2** - Incremental approach, validate each phase

---

## Performance Targets (Revised)

| Phase | Target | Actual | vs RocksDB |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| Current | - | 750K ops/sec | 6.7x slower |
| Phase 1 (AsyncWAL) | 1.4-1.9M | **N/A - Won't Help** ‚ùå | Would still block |
| Phase 2 (WriteBuffer) | 3-5M | TBD | Match or exceed! üéØ |

**Revised Goal:** Close gap from 6.7x to ~1x with write buffer layer, potentially matching/exceeding RocksDB.

## What to Tell Me Next Session

Just say: **"Implement write buffer layer"** or **"Start Phase 2/3"**

I'll:
1. Read this file and the design doc
2. Create WriteBufferLayer struct with in-memory writes
3. Integrate into transaction commit path
4. Implement background flush to B-tree
5. Run benchmarks - expect 3-5M ops/sec (match RocksDB!)
6. Update progress in `docs/wal_pipelining_design.md`

**Alternative:** If you want to validate the AsyncWAL work first, say **"Test AsyncWAL directly"** and I'll create a standalone benchmark to show it works (just won't help main benchmark).
