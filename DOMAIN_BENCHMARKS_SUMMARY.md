## Benchmark Architecture

### Common Patterns

All benchmarks follow consistent patterns:

1. **Warmup + Benchmark Iterations**
   - 1 warmup iteration
   - 3 benchmark iterations (averaged)
   - Reduces measurement variance

2. **File Descriptor Management**
   - Explicit `drop(db)` after each test
   - 50ms sleep for cleanup
   - Prevents "Too many open files" errors

3. **Stress Tests**
   - 30-second sustained writes
   - 5-second mixed workloads
   - Multi-threaded concurrent access

4. **Output Formatting**
   - Duration: µs/ms/s formatting
   - Throughput: ops/sec, K ops/sec, M ops/sec
   - Consistent 80-column layout

### Configuration

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
manifold-vectors = { path = "../manifold-vectors" }
manifold-graph = { path = "../manifold-graph" }
manifold-timeseries = { path = "../manifold-timeseries" }
uuid = { version = "1.17.0", features = ["v4"] }
```

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Individual benchmarks
cargo bench --bench vectors_benchmark
cargo bench --bench graph_benchmark
cargo bench --bench timeseries_benchmark

# All domain benchmarks
cargo bench --bench vectors_benchmark --bench graph_benchmark --bench timeseries_benchmark

# Specific test within benchmark
cargo bench --bench vectors_benchmark -- "Sustained Write"
```

## Performance Insights

### Vectors

- **Write performance**: 55-75K ops/sec (batch inserts)
- **Sustained writes**: 11-41K ops/sec (1-8 threads)
- **Distance computations**: 700K+ ops/sec

### Graph
- **Batch inserts**: Testing sorted vs unsorted optimization

## Implementation Notes

### Challenges Solved

1. **API Signature Mismatches**
   - Graph: `add_edges_batch` takes `&[(Uuid, &str, Uuid, bool, f32)]`
   - Graph: `outgoing_edges`/`incoming_edges` don't filter by edge_type
   - Time Series: `write_batch` requires `sorted` parameter
   - Time Series: Specific downsampling methods, not generic

2. **File Descriptor Exhaustion**
   - Reduced iterations (7 → 4 per test)
   - Added explicit cleanup between tests
   - 50ms sleep after `drop(db)`

3. **Edge Type Handling**
   - Edge fields are public, not methods
   - Manual filtering in traversal benchmarks

### Code Quality

- ✅ All benchmarks compile without errors
- ✅ Only 1 warning per benchmark (unused variable)
- ✅ Consistent formatting and structure
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Production-ready code

## Summary

Successfully created comprehensive benchmark suite for all three domain optimization phases:

- **Vectors**: 631 lines, 7 test dimensions
- **Graph**: 782 lines, 9 test dimensions  
- **Time Series**: 733 lines, 7 test dimensions

Total: **2,146 lines of production-quality benchmark code** testing 23 distinct performance dimensions across the domain-specialized crates.

All benchmarks follow consistent patterns, prevent file descriptor leaks, and provide detailed performance insights for the domain optimization architecture.

## Bug Fixes

### Graph Benchmark - Duplicate Edge Handling

**Issue:** The full graph iteration test was asserting exact edge count, but random edge generation creates duplicates (same source + edge_type + target), which get overwritten in the graph since that's the composite key.

**Fix:** 
- Changed `benchmark_full_iteration()` to return `(Duration, usize)` - actual count
- Removed assertion
- Display both target and actual edge counts
- Use actual count for throughput calculation

**Example Output:**
```
10000 edges (actual: 9604)                                943µs   10.18M ops/sec
50000 edges (actual: 49590)                              4.75ms   10.45M ops/sec
```

This is expected behavior - ~96% unique edges with random generation is reasonable and makes the benchmark more realistic.

### Time Series Benchmark

✅ No issues found - runs successfully without panics.
