# Manifold Domain Optimization Plan v0.1.2

## Executive Summary

Manifold has achieved its goal as a high-performance, general-purpose embedded column family database with concurrent writes (451K ops/sec), WAL-based durability, and full WASM support. This document outlines specialized optimizations for domain-specific workloads while maintaining Manifold's general-purpose nature.

**Core Principle:** Keep Manifold's core general-purpose and build domain-specific functionality as optional layers on top, implemented as separate crates that depend on Manifold.

**Architecture Strategy:** Use column families as logical collections (e.g., "news_articles", "user_profiles"), with multiple specialized tables within each collection for different data types and indexes. This enables atomic updates across related data while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

**Session Update (v0.1.2):** Phase 1 (manifold-vectors) completed and production-ready! Implements efficient guard-based access optimized for high-throughput read workloads. All core functionality tested and working. See Phase 1 implementation notes below for details.

## Project Context: Tables Within Column Families

**Critical architectural decision made during Phase 3-4 development:**

A column family in Manifold is not just a namespace - it's a **logical collection** that can contain multiple tables. Each table is a separate B-tree with its own key-value space, but all tables within a column family:
- Share the same write transaction isolation
- Can be updated atomically together
- Use the same underlying storage segment(s)
- Benefit from the same WAL group commit batching

**Example organization:**
```
Column Family: "news_articles"
├── Table: "articles"        (String → Article struct)
├── Table: "vectors_dense"   (String → [f32; 768])
├── Table: "vectors_sparse"  (String → SparseVector)
├── Table: "metadata"        (String → Metadata)
└── Table: "sentiment"       (String → f32)
```

**Why this matters for domain optimizations:**

When we build domain-specific helpers (VectorTable, GraphTable, etc.), they're not creating new column families - they're organizing multiple tables within a single column family. This is crucial because:

1. **Atomic updates** - Insert article + embedding + metadata in one transaction
2. **Efficient queries** - Range scan metadata, look up embedding by ID, all within same CF
3. **Storage efficiency** - Related data in same segments, better cache locality
4. **Transaction isolation** - One writer per collection, not one per data type

**When to use separate column families:**

Only for truly independent collections with no need for cross-collection atomic updates:
- `news_articles` vs `user_profiles` vs `chat_messages` - separate CFs
- But within `news_articles`: article text, embeddings, metadata - same CF, different tables

This understanding shapes how we design the domain optimization crates below.

## Project Context: Why Domain Layers?

**Decision point from completion plan Phase 5.7:**

After implementing WAL and achieving 4.7x performance improvement, we realized Manifold's core is feature-complete for general-purpose use. The next evolution is not more core features, but **domain-specific helpers** that make common patterns easier.

**Why separate crates instead of core features:**

1. **Maintainability** - Core stays focused on correctness and performance of key-value primitives
2. **Optional dependencies** - ML users don't need graph code, graph users don't need ML code
3. **Independent evolution** - Domain layers can break API, iterate faster, release independently
4. **Community contributions** - Domain experts can own specific layers without touching core
5. **Testing isolation** - Each layer tested independently, easier to validate correctness

**Integration pattern established:**

Domain layers provide trait-based abstractions wrapping `ColumnFamily`:
```rust
pub trait VectorStore {
    fn insert(&self, key: &str, vector: &[f32]) -> Result<()>;
    fn get_zero_copy(&self, key: &str) -> Result<&[f32]>;
    fn nearest(&self, query: &[f32], k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f32)>>;
}

// Implementation wraps ColumnFamily, uses internal tables
impl VectorStore for VectorTable<const DIM: usize> {
    // Uses cf.open_table("vectors") internally
}
```

Users interact with domain-specific APIs, but underneath it's just organized use of Manifold's tables.

---

## Architecture: Domain Layers as Separate Crates

**Crate organization decided:**

```
manifold (this repository - core database)
    └── provides: ColumnFamilyDatabase, Table, WAL, StorageBackend

manifold-vectors (separate crate)
    └── provides: VectorTable<DIM>, SparseVectorTable, MultiVectorTable
    └── depends on: manifold

manifold-graph (separate crate)
    └── provides: GraphTable, edge query APIs
    └── depends on: manifold

manifold-timeseries (separate crate)
    └── provides: TimeSeriesTable, downsampling, retention
    └── depends on: manifold
```

**User application layer:**
```rust
// User can pick and choose
use manifold::ColumnFamilyDatabase;
use manifold_vectors::VectorTable;
use manifold_graph::GraphTable;

// Or use raw Manifold if domain layers don't fit
```

**Note on hyperspatial:**

Hyperspatial exists as a separate repository with its own requirements. Hyperbolic embeddings, if needed, are just fixed-width vectors (e.g., `VectorTable<17>`) from Phase 1. Custom distance functions and spatial indexing specific to hyperbolic geometry belong in hyperspatial's repository, not in these general-purpose domain layers.

---

## Phase 1: Vector Table Optimization

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Production Ready

**Objective:** Provide efficient storage and access patterns for vector embeddings (dense, sparse, multi-vector formats) commonly used in ML/AI applications.

**Actual Time:** ~12 hours (within estimate)

### Project Context

**Problem identified during WASM development:**

When implementing the WASM example, we stored embeddings as serialized byte arrays. This works but has overhead:
- Deserialization on every read (bincode/serde overhead)
- Allocations for temporary buffers
- No type safety - easy to mix up vector dimensions
- Difficult to integrate with external vector index libraries (HNSW, FAISS, etc.)

**Design decision:**

Use Rust's `fixed_width()` trait (already in Manifold's `Value` trait) to enable zero-copy access for fixed-size arrays. This is already supported in the core - we just need convenient wrappers.

**What this phase adds:**

Not new storage mechanisms - Manifold already handles this. What we're adding is:
1. **Type-safe wrappers** - `VectorTable<768>` with compile-time dimension checking
2. **Zero-copy convenience** - `get_zero_copy()` helper avoiding manual unsafe code
3. **Batch operations** - Optimized bulk insertion leveraging WAL group commit
4. **Integration points** - Traits for external index libraries to consume table data

### Design

**1. VectorTable<const DIM: usize>**

Fixed-dimension dense vectors with compile-time dimension validation:

```rust
let vectors: VectorTable<768> = VectorTable::new(&cf, "embeddings")?;

// Insert (copies into Manifold's storage)
vectors.insert("doc_123", &embedding)?;

// Zero-copy access (returns slice into mmap'd storage)
let vec: &[f32; 768] = vectors.get_zero_copy("doc_123")?;
```

**Implementation note:** Uses `fixed_width()` to bypass serialization entirely.

**2. SparseVectorTable**

For high-dimensional sparse features (TF-IDF, BM25):

```rust
let sparse: SparseVectorTable = SparseVectorTable::new(&cf, "features")?;

// Store only non-zero entries (index, value) pairs
sparse.insert("doc_123", &[(0, 0.5), (42, 0.8), (1000, 0.3)])?;
```

**Implementation note:** COO (coordinate) format, compressed during serialization.

**3. MultiVectorTable<const DIM: usize>**

For Colbert-style token embeddings (variable-length sequences):

```rust
let multi: MultiVectorTable<128> = MultiVectorTable::new(&cf, "tokens")?;

// Store sequence of vectors (one per token)
multi.insert("doc_123", &[vec1, vec2, vec3])?;
```

**Implementation note:** Length-prefixed format, each vector zero-copy accessible.

**4. Integration Helpers**

Not building indexes in Manifold - providing integration points:

```rust
// Trait for index builders to consume table data
pub trait VectorSource<const DIM: usize> {
    fn iter(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = (&str, &[f32; DIM])>;
}

impl<const DIM: usize> VectorSource<DIM> for VectorTable<DIM> {
    // Efficient iteration for index building
}

// User code:
let hnsw_index = HnswIndex::from_source(&vectors, params)?;
```

### Implementation Summary

**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE and production-ready for high-throughput workloads

**Files Created:**
- `crates/manifold-vectors/Cargo.toml` - Crate configuration
- `crates/manifold-vectors/src/lib.rs` - Public API and documentation
- `crates/manifold-vectors/src/dense.rs` - Dense vector table with guard-based access
- `crates/manifold-vectors/src/sparse.rs` - Sparse vector table with COO format
- `crates/manifold-vectors/src/multi.rs` - Multi-vector table for sequences

- `crates/manifold-vectors/src/integration.rs` - VectorSource trait for external libraries
- `crates/manifold-vectors/tests/integration_tests.rs` - 7 comprehensive tests

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **VectorGuard caches deserialized array** - Avoids repeated parsing, one 3KB stack allocation per guard
2. **No hard-coded limits** - All dimensions via const generics, all counts via dynamic Vec
3. **Deref coercion** - Guards work seamlessly with distance functions
4. **Separation of read/write** - `VectorTable` for writes, `VectorTableRead` for reads
5. **COO for sparse** - Simpler than CSR, sufficient for most use cases, completely flexible

**Performance Characteristics (for 768-dim vectors):**
- Write: O(log n) B-tree insert, WAL group commit benefit
- Read: O(log n) lookup + one deserialization (essentially memcpy for arrays)
- Memory: 3KB stack per guard, zero heap allocations
- Batch insert: Leverages Manifold's sorted fast-path when applicable

**Flexibility Confirmed:**
- Dense: Any dimension via `VectorTable<DIM>` - tested from 3 to 128 dimensions
- Sparse: Unbounded dimensionality and entry count - dynamic Vec growth
- Multi: Variable sequence length per entry - completely dynamic
- Keys: String keys currently, extensible to other types

**Ready for:** Hyperspatial's high-read workload with hyperbolic indexing and trajectory tracking

## Phase 2: Graph Table Optimization

**Status:** Not Started

**Objective:** Efficient edge storage and traversal for graph workloads with support for bidirectional queries and property graphs.

**Estimated Time:** 10-14 hours

### Project Context

**Problem identified during Phase 5 testing:**

When testing concurrent writes to different column families, we realized graph edges are a natural fit for Manifold's architecture:
- Edge insertion is high-throughput (benefits from WAL group commit)
- Traversal is read-heavy (benefits from lock-free MVCC reads)
- Edges often need bidirectional access (forward and reverse)

However, manually designing keys for efficient graph queries is error-prone. Users need to understand:
- Composite key encoding for range scans
- Maintaining reverse indexes manually
- Handling edge properties consistently

**Design decision:**

Provide a `GraphTable` wrapper that handles composite keys and reverse indexes automatically, while using Manifold's existing table primitives underneath.

**What this phase adds:**

Not a new graph database - Manifold already supports the primitives. What we're adding:
1. **Composite key abstraction** - Hide `{source}|{edge_type}|{target}` encoding
2. **Automatic reverse index** - Maintain forward + reverse tables atomically
3. **Query helpers** - Outgoing/incoming edge iterators using range scans
4. **Property handling** - Type-safe edge property storage

### Design

**1. Composite Key Encoding**

```rust
// Internal encoding: "{source}|{edge_type}|{target}"
// Enables efficient queries:
// - All edges from vertex: range scan "{source}|"
// - All edges of type: iterate and filter (no index for this)
// - Specific edge: exact lookup

// User never sees this encoding:
graph.add_edge("user_123", "follows", "user_456", properties)?;
```

**Implementation note:** Use null-byte separators for range scan safety.

**2. GraphTable API**

```rust
let graph: GraphTable = GraphTable::new(&cf, "edges")?;

// Add edge (updates forward + reverse tables atomically)
graph.add_edge("user_123", "follows", "user_456", properties)?;

// Query patterns
for edge in graph.outgoing_edges("user_123")? {
    // Range scan on forward table
}

for edge in graph.incoming_edges("user_456")? {
    // Range scan on reverse table
}

// Specific edge lookup
let props = graph.get_edge("user_123", "follows", "user_456")?;
```

**3. Bidirectional Support**

Two internal tables within the same column family:
- `edges_forward` - Primary edge storage
- `edges_reverse` - Reverse index for incoming edge queries

Both updated atomically in same transaction (benefit of column family design).

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] **2.1: Composite key encoding**
  - Implement null-byte separated encoding
  - Support String, u64, UUID vertex ID types
  - Range-scan safe encoding
  - **Dev Notes:**

  - Outgoing/incoming edge iterators (range scans)
  - Edge type filtering
  - Property access

  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **2.6: Examples and documentation**

- ✅ Atomic bidirectional edge updates
- ✅ Property graph support
- ✅ Integration with graph algorithm libraries
- ✅ Real-world examples

## Phase 3: Time Series Table Optimization

**Status:** Not Started

**Objective:** Efficient storage and querying of time-series data with automatic downsampling and retention policies.

**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

### Project Context

**Problem identified during benchmarking:**

Manifold's high write throughput (451K ops/sec) makes it well-suited for time-series workloads (metrics, IoT sensors, logs). However, time-series has specific patterns:
- Timestamp-ordered keys for efficient range queries
- Need for multiple granularities (raw, minute, hour, day)
- Automatic retention and cleanup of old data

**Design decision:**

Use timestamp-prefixed keys for natural ordering, and leverage Manifold's multiple-tables-per-CF design for different granularities. All within one column family for atomic updates.

**What this phase adds:**

Not time-series specific storage - Manifold's ordered key-value already handles this. What we're adding:
1. **Timestamp encoding** - Consistent key format for range queries
2. **Multi-granularity tables** - Raw + downsampled in same CF
3. **Background downsampling** - Async task reading raw, writing aggregates
4. **Retention helpers** - Automatic deletion of old data

### Design

**1. Timestamp-Prefixed Keys**

```rust
// Internal encoding: "{timestamp}|{series_id}"
// Manifold's lexicographic ordering gives time-order iteration

// User API:
ts.write("cpu.usage", timestamp, value)?;
```

**Implementation note:** Timestamp encoded as sortable bytes (big-endian u64).

**2. Multi-Granularity Storage**

```rust
// Within column family "metrics":
// - table "raw": Full resolution data
// - table "minute": 1-minute aggregates (min, max, avg, count)
// - table "hour": Hourly rollups
// - table "day": Daily summaries

let tables = TimeSeriesTables::new(&cf)?;
tables.write_raw("cpu.usage", timestamp, value)?;

// Background task (or manual):
tables.downsample_to_minute()?;
tables.downsample_to_hour()?;
```

**3. Retention Policies**

```rust
// Delete data older than threshold
tables.apply_retention(
    granularity = "raw",
    keep_duration = Duration::from_days(7)
)?;
```

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] **3.1: Key encoding**
  - Sortable timestamp encoding (big-endian u64)
  - Series ID encoding
  - Composite key helpers
  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **3.2: TimeSeriesTable implementation**
  - Write/read operations
  - Range queries by time
  - Efficient iteration
  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **3.3: Multi-granularity tables**
  - Multiple tables within same CF
  - Downsampling logic (min, max, avg, sum, count)
  - Atomic writes across granularities
  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **3.4: Background tasks**
  - Optional background downsampling (separate thread)
  - Manual downsampling API
  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **3.5: Retention policies**
  - Automatic deletion by age
  - Per-granularity retention
  - Background cleanup task
  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **3.6: Examples and documentation**
  - Metrics collection example
  - IoT sensor data example
  - Benchmarks (write throughput, query performance)
  - **Dev Notes:**

### Success Criteria

- ✅ High write throughput (> 100K points/sec)
- ✅ Efficient range queries
- ✅ Automatic downsampling working
- ✅ Retention policies enforced
- ✅ Examples for common patterns

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequencing

**Phase 1 (Vectors) first:**
- Most common use case in modern applications
- Establishes patterns for other domain layers
- Simpler than graphs or time-series (no multi-table coordination)
- Immediate value for ML/AI workloads

**Phase 2 (Graph) second:**
- Complements vectors (RAG systems often combine vector search + knowledge graphs)
- Introduces multi-table atomic updates pattern
- Composite key encoding applies to other scenarios

**Phase 3 (Time Series) third:**
- Builds on multi-table patterns from Phase 2
- Adds background task patterns (downsampling, retention)
- Completes the trio of common domain workloads

### Development Process

For each phase:
1. **Design doc** - Detailed design with examples, review before implementation
2. **Prototype** - Build core functionality in separate crate
3. **Test** - Unit tests + integration tests + benchmarks
4. **Document** - API docs, usage examples, performance characteristics
5. **Publish** - Release as separate crate with clear versioning

### Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Vectors)** - No dependencies, can start immediately after finalization plan complete
- **Phase 2 (Graph)** - Independent, could run parallel with Phase 1
- **Phase 3 (Time Series)** - Benefits from Phase 2 patterns, but not strictly dependent

### Timeline

**Sequential development:**
- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 1.5 weeks
- Phase 3: 1-1.5 weeks
- **Total: 4.5-5 weeks**

**Parallel development (if multiple developers):**
- All phases: 2-3 weeks

---

## Success Criteria

### Per-Phase Success

Each phase is considered complete when:
- ✅ Core functionality implemented and tested
- ✅ Performance benchmarks meet targets
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation written
- ✅ Examples demonstrate real-world usage
- ✅ Published as separate crate with clear versioning

### Overall Success

Domain optimization suite is complete when:
- ✅ All three phases complete and published
- ✅ Performance validated in realistic workloads
- ✅ Documentation enables users to adopt domain layers easily
- ✅ Patterns established for community to build additional domain layers

---

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Versioning Strategy

- **manifold-core:** Semantic versioning (currently tracking completion plan)
- **Domain crates:** Independent semantic versioning
- **Compatibility:** Domain layers specify minimum manifold-core version

Each domain crate can evolve independently without affecting core or other domain layers.

### Future Domain Layers

The patterns established here enable future community contributions:
- **manifold-geospatial** - Geographic data and spatial indexes
- **manifold-document** - Document storage with metadata
- **manifold-ml** - Direct integration with ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Others as community needs emerge

### Performance Monitoring

Each domain layer should:
- Include benchmark suite
- Track performance across versions
- Document performance characteristics clearly
- Provide tuning guidance

---

## Notes

- This plan is versioned (v0.1.2) to track evolution
- Update version when making substantial changes to approach or scope
- Each phase should update this document with learnings and design decisions
- **v0.1.2 Update:** Phase 1 complete with guard-based access pattern optimized for high-read workloads
- Domain layers remain optional - users can use Manifold core directly if preferred
- Focus on enabling patterns, not prescribing solutions
- Hyperspatial-specific optimizations (hyperbolic embeddings, spatial indexing) remain in hyperspatial repository, not in these general-purpose domain layers
