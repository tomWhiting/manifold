# Iterator Fix for WASM Example

## Issue

When using the "List All Data" button in the WASM example, got error:
```
List failed: undefined is not a function (near '...[key, value]...')
```

## Root Cause

**JavaScript destructuring with for-of loops doesn't work on WASM-returned arrays.**

The original code:
```javascript
for (const [key, value] of batch) {
    entries.push({ key, value });
}
```

This fails because `js_sys::Array` returned from WASM doesn't implement JavaScript's `Symbol.iterator` protocol needed for for-of loops.

## Solution

Use index-based iteration instead:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < batch.length; i++) {
    const pair = batch[i];
    const key = pair[0];
    const value = pair[1];
    entries.push({ key, value });
}
```

## Files Changed

1. **examples/wasm/worker.js** - Updated `listAll` case to use index-based iteration
2. **examples/wasm/TESTING.md** - Updated test examples to show correct pattern
3. **COMPLETION_PLAN.md** - Added note about the fix

## Why This Happens

When Rust/WASM returns a `js_sys::Array`:
- JavaScript receives it as a native Array object
- The `.length` property works
- Array indexing `arr[i]` works  
- **BUT** the iterator protocol (`Symbol.iterator`) is not properly set up
- So `for (const x of arr)` fails

This is a known limitation of wasm-bindgen's array handling.

## Workaround Patterns

### ❌ Don't Use (Won't Work)
```javascript
for (const item of wasmArray) { }           // Fails
for (const [k, v] of wasmArray) { }         // Fails
wasmArray.forEach(item => { })              // May fail
[...wasmArray]                              // May fail
```

### ✅ Use Instead
```javascript
// Index-based iteration (always works)
for (let i = 0; i < wasmArray.length; i++) {
    const item = wasmArray[i];
}

// Or convert to JS array first
const jsArray = Array.from(wasmArray);
for (const item of jsArray) { }             // Now works
```

## Rebuild Instructions

After making the fix:

```bash
cd /path/to/redb
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir examples/wasm/pkg
```

Then refresh your browser and try "List All Data" again.

## Verification

After the fix, clicking "List All Data" should:
- Show log: "Listed N entries from [column_family_name]"
- Display all key-value pairs in the table
- No errors in console

## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

1. **Return plain JavaScript arrays**: Would require more complex serialization
2. **Use serde-wasm-bindgen**: Adds dependency and complexity
3. **Manual Symbol.iterator**: Complex to implement correctly

The index-based approach is simple, fast, and reliable.

## Summary

The iterator works correctly - the issue was just how we access the returned data in JavaScript. Index-based loops are the standard pattern for WASM-returned arrays.
