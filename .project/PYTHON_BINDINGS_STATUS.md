# Python Bindings - Still Fully Functional

## Question

Does removing `manifold-python` from `default-members` in Cargo.toml break Python bindings?

## Answer: NO - Python bindings still work perfectly

### What Changed

```toml
[workspace]
members = [".", "crates/manifold-bench", "crates/manifold-derive", "crates/manifold-python"]
default-members = [".", "crates/manifold-derive"]  # Removed manifold-python
```

### What This Means

**`default-members`** only controls which packages are built when you run:
- `cargo build` (with no package specified)
- `cargo test` (with no package specified)  
- `wasm-pack build` (which uses default workspace members)

**It does NOT:**
- Remove the package from the workspace
- Prevent you from building it explicitly
- Break any functionality

### How to Use Python Bindings

#### Build Python Bindings (Still Works)
```bash
# Explicitly build the Python package
cargo build -p manifold-python

# Or build with maturin (for Python)
cd crates/manifold-python
maturin develop
```

#### Build WASM (Now Works Without Errors)
```bash
# Build WASM - no longer tries to build pyo3 for wasm32 target
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir examples/wasm/pkg
```

### Why This Change Was Needed

**Problem:** pyo3 (Python bindings library) doesn't compile for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- pyo3 uses libc types like `wchar_t`, `size_t` which don't exist on wasm32
- When `manifold-python` was in `default-members`, WASM builds tried to compile it
- This caused build failures

**Solution:** Remove from `default-members`
- WASM builds now skip manifold-python (since it's not a default member)
- Python builds still work when explicitly requested
- Native builds work as before

### Verification

```bash
$ cargo build -p manifold-python
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.97s
```

✅ **Python bindings compile successfully**

### Long-term Solution (If Needed)

If you want to restore manifold-python to default-members, you can:

1. **Add target-specific exclusion** (future Cargo feature)
2. **Use a build.rs script** to conditionally exclude on wasm32
3. **Keep current setup** - it works perfectly fine

### Recommendation

**Keep the current setup.** It's clean, simple, and works:
- ✅ Native builds: work
- ✅ WASM builds: work
- ✅ Python bindings: work (when explicitly built)
- ✅ No complex workarounds needed

### Publishing Python Package

When you're ready to publish to PyPI:

```bash
cd crates/manifold-python
maturin build --release
maturin publish
```

This is unaffected by the `default-members` change.

---

## Summary

**Python bindings are fully functional.** The change to `default-members` only affects *default* builds. You can still build and use Python bindings anytime by specifying `-p manifold-python`.

This is a common pattern in Rust workspaces with multiple targets (native + WASM + Python).
