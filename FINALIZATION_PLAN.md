# Manifold Finalization Plan

## Overview

Manifold has achieved feature-complete status as a high-performance embedded column family database with concurrent writes, WAL-based durability, and full WASM support. This document outlines the remaining tasks to prepare Manifold for production use and optimize it for domain-specific workloads.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Column family architecture with concurrent writes (451K ops/sec at 8 threads)
- ✅ Write-Ahead Log with group commit and crash recovery
- ✅ Full WASM support with OPFS, iteration, and WAL
- ✅ API simplification complete (WAL enabled by default)
- ✅ All 98 tests passing

**Remaining Work:**
- 🚧 Comprehensive benchmarking suite
- 🚧 Production error handling audit
- 🚧 API ergonomics polish

---

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite

**Objective:** Establish performance baselines across various workloads to guide future optimizations and provide confidence in production deployment.

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

### Tasks

- [x] **1.1: Benchmark harness infrastructure**
  - ✅ Created `crates/manifold-bench/benches/` with benchmark suite
  - ✅ Set up reproducible environment with warmup iterations
  - ✅ Configured detailed statistics output (mean, p50, p95, p99)
  - ✅ Created `wal_comparison.rs` example for WAL vs no-WAL testing
  - **Dev Notes:** 
    - `column_family_benchmark.rs` provides comprehensive production-realistic patterns
    - 3 warmup iterations + 10 benchmark iterations per test
    - All benchmarks use 1KB values with 1000 writes per batch

- [x] **1.2: Small write workload benchmarks**
  - ✅ Benchmarked single-threaded sequential writes (baseline: 91-96K ops/sec)
  - ✅ Benchmarked concurrent writes (2, 4, 8 CFs: 148K, 186-220K, 270-315K ops/sec)
  - ✅ Measured with and without WAL (`wal_comparison.rs`: 458K vs 235K at 8 threads)
  - ✅ Sequential key patterns tested (batch writes)
  - **Target:** ✅ Established baseline for typical CRUD operations
  - **Dev Notes:**
    - **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:** Discovered and fixed race condition in concurrent auto-expansion
    - Without fix: benchmark panics with "assertion failed: storage.raw_file_len()? >= header.layout().len()"
    - Root cause: Multiple `PartitionedStorageBackend` instances racing on file growth via different handles
    - Solution: Implemented per-file `Arc<Mutex<()>>` in `FileHandlePool` to serialize `set_len()` operations
    - Fix enables concurrent CF operations for the first time - benchmarks now complete successfully
    - Performance is actual working baseline (not regression)

- [ ] **1.3: Large write workload benchmarks**

  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **1.7: WASM-specific benchmarks**
  - Benchmark OPFS backend performance in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Measure WASM overhead vs native (same operations)
  - Test batch iterator performance with various batch sizes
  - Compare checkpoint performance (async vs threaded)
  - **Target:** Quantify browser performance characteristics
  - **Dev Notes:**

- [ ] **1.8: Comparison benchmarks**
  - Benchmark vanilla redb for baseline comparison
  - Document performance improvements (expected: 4.7x)
  - Create performance comparison charts
  - Add benchmark results to README
  - **Target:** Demonstrate value proposition clearly

## Phase 5: Domain-Specific Optimizations (Future)

**Objective:** Build specialized table types and helper APIs for common workloads without compromising Manifold's general-purpose nature.

**Status:** Deferred until Phases 1-4 complete

### 5.1: Vector Table Optimization

**Concept:** Helper API for storing and querying vector embeddings within column families.

**Design:**
- `VectorTable<const DIM: usize>` - typed wrapper for fixed-dimension vectors
- Zero-copy access via `fixed_width()` trait
- Batch insert optimized for bulk embedding storage
- Integration with external vector index libraries (HNSW, IVF-PQ)
- Support dense, sparse, and multi-vector formats

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "news_articles"
├── Table: "articles"        (String → Article)
├── Table: "vectors_dense"   (VectorTable<768> → [f32; 768])
├── Table: "vectors_sparse"  (String → SparseVector)
└── Table: "metadata"        (String → Metadata)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-vectors` depending on `manifold`

### 5.2: Graph Table Optimization

**Concept:** Efficient edge storage with composite keys for graph workloads.

**Design:**
- Composite key format: `{source}|{edge_type}|{target}`
- Bidirectional edges via separate reverse table
- Range queries for "all edges from vertex X"
- Batch edge insertion via transaction groups
- Integration with graph algorithms

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "social_graph"
├── Table: "edges_forward"   (CompositeKey → EdgeData)
├── Table: "edges_reverse"   (CompositeKey → EdgeData)
├── Table: "vertices"        (String → VertexData)
└── Table: "properties"      (String → Property)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-graph` depending on `manifold`

### 5.3: Time Series Table Optimization

**Concept:** Timestamp-prefixed keys with downsampling support.

**Design:**
- Key format: `{timestamp}|{series_id}`
- Multiple tables for different granularities (raw, minute, hour, day)
- Automatic downsampling via background task
- Efficient range queries by timestamp
- Retention policy support

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "metrics"
├── Table: "raw"             ({timestamp}|{series} → Value)
├── Table: "minute"          ({timestamp}|{series} → Aggregate)
├── Table: "hour"            ({timestamp}|{series} → Aggregate)
└── Table: "metadata"        (String → SeriesMetadata)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-timeseries` depending on `manifold`

### 5.4: Hyperbolic Space Optimization

**Concept:** Specialized storage for hyperbolic embeddings and spatial indexing.

**Design:**
- Fixed-width storage for N-dimensional hyperbolic coordinates
- Custom distance functions (hyperbolic distance, not Euclidean)
- Spatial index structure preserving hyperbolic properties
- Integration with hyperbolic geometry libraries
- Support for Poincaré disk and hyperboloid models

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "hyperbolic_embeddings"
├── Table: "coordinates"     (ID → [f64; 17])
├── Table: "spatial_index"   (HyperbolicKey → BucketData)
└── Table: "metadata"        (ID → Metadata)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-hyperbolic` depending on `manifold`

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Keep Manifold general-purpose** - no specialized types in core
2. **Build domain layers as separate crates** - optional dependencies
3. **Use trait-based abstractions** - `VectorStore`, `GraphStore`, etc.
4. **Compose within column families** - multiple tables per logical collection
5. **Provide examples** - show integration patterns clearly

**Timeline:** Start after benchmarking, error handling, and API polish complete
