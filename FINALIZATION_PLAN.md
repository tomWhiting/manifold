- 🚧 Production error handling audit
- 🚧 API ergonomics polish

---

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite

**Objective:** Establish performance baselines across various workloads to guide future optimizations and provide confidence in production deployment.

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

### Tasks

- [x] **1.1: Benchmark harness infrastructure**
  - ✅ Created `crates/manifold-bench/benches/` with comprehensive benchmark suite
  - ✅ Set up reproducible environment with warmup iterations
  - ✅ Configured detailed statistics output (mean, p50, p95, p99)
  - ✅ Created `wal_comparison.rs` example for WAL vs no-WAL testing
  - ✅ Created `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md` comprehensive results document
  - **Dev Notes:** 
    - `column_family_benchmark.rs` provides comprehensive production-realistic patterns
    - All benchmarks use 1KB values with 1000 writes per batch (consistent)
    - Results documented in `crates/manifold-bench/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`

- [x] **1.2: Small write workload benchmarks**
  - ✅ Benchmarked single-threaded sequential writes (baseline: 91-96K ops/sec)
  - ✅ Benchmarked concurrent writes (2, 4, 8 CFs: 148K, 186-220K, 270-315K ops/sec)
  - ✅ Measured with and without WAL (`wal_comparison.rs`: 458K vs 235K at 8 threads)
  - ✅ Sequential key patterns tested (batch writes)
  - **Target:** ✅ Established baseline for typical CRUD operations
  - **Dev Notes:**
    - **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:** Discovered and fixed race condition in concurrent auto-expansion
    - Without fix: benchmark panics with "assertion failed: storage.raw_file_len()? >= header.layout().len()"
    - Root cause: Multiple `PartitionedStorageBackend` instances racing on file growth via different handles
    - Solution: Implemented per-file `Arc<Mutex<()>>` in `FileHandlePool` to serialize `set_len()` operations
    - Fix enables concurrent CF operations for the first time - benchmarks now complete successfully
    - Performance is actual working baseline (not regression)

- [ ] **1.3: Large write workload benchmarks**
  - Benchmark writes with 1KB, 10KB, 100KB, 1MB values
  - Measure WAL overhead vs direct commit for large values

  - ✅ Tested reads during concurrent writes (3.9M-2.46M read ops/sec with 1-4 writers)
  - ✅ Measured range scan performance (100-50K entries: 864K-1.08M ops/sec)
  - ✅ Tested iterator batch sizes (10-5000: all ~9.6-10.3M ops/sec, minimal impact)
  - **Target:** ✅ Optimized for analytics/query workloads
  - **Dev Notes:**
    - Read concurrency scales well up to 8 readers (6.74M ops/sec peak)
    - Readers maintain high throughput even during concurrent writes
    - Iterator batch size has minimal impact in 10-5000 range
    - Implemented in `read_heavy_benchmark.rs`

- [x] **1.5: Mixed workload benchmarks**
  - ✅ Benchmarked read/write ratios (80/20: 6.51M, 50/50: 2.43M, 20/80: 1.59M ops/sec)
  - ✅ Tested multi-CF operations (8 CFs × 1 thread optimal: 1.87M ops/sec)
  - ✅ Measured thread scalability 1-16 threads (4.56M ops/sec at 16 threads, 20x speedup)
  - ✅ Simulated Zipfian access patterns (80/20 hot/cold: 6.17M ops/sec)
  - **Target:** ✅ Production behavior modeled
  - **Dev Notes:**
    - More CFs with fewer threads outperforms fewer CFs with many threads
    - Excellent scaling: near-linear up to 8 threads, continued improvement to 16
    - 1000-op batches with default durability critical for performance
    - Implemented in `mixed_workload_benchmark.rs`

- [x] **1.6: WAL-specific benchmarks**
  - ✅ Measured WAL vs no-WAL (1.64x speedup: 273K vs 166K ops/sec at 8 threads)
  - ✅ Tested durability modes (Default WAL: 81.3K, None: 77.4K, Immediate: 71.2K ops/sec)
  - ✅ Benchmarked write latency percentiles (p50: 10.24ms, p95: 16.36ms, p99: 53.80ms)
  - ✅ Measured WAL recovery (20K entries in 61ms, 326K entries/sec, 100% integrity)
  - ✅ Tested group commit scaling (optimal at 8 threads: 224K ops/sec)
  - **Target:** ✅ WAL performance validated
  - **Dev Notes:**
    - WAL provides 1.64x throughput improvement through group commit batching
    - Tight latency percentile spreads indicate consistent performance
    - Fast, reliable crash recovery with full data integrity

  - ✅ 8 concurrent threads: 4.80x faster (426K vs 88K ops/sec)
  - **Target:** ✅ Value proposition clearly demonstrated
  - **Dev Notes:**
    - Manifold's column family architecture enables true parallel writes
    - Vanilla redb serializes all write transactions (major bottleneck)
    - Reads are comparable (1.05-1.20x faster)
    - Speedup increases with concurrency level (2x @ 2 threads → 4.8x @ 8 threads)
    - Implemented in `redb_comparison_benchmark.rs`

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Reproducible benchmark suite runs successfully
- ✅ Performance baselines documented for all major workload types
- ✅ Comprehensive results published in `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`
- ⏳ CI integration for regression detection (planned for future)
- ⏳ WASM browser benchmarks (deferred - requires different infrastructure)

**Current Status:** Phase 1 is **75% complete** (6 of 8 tasks)
- ✅ Infrastructure, small writes, read-heavy, mixed workloads complete
- ✅ WAL-specific and vanilla redb comparison complete
- ✅ Critical race condition fixed enabling concurrent operations
- ✅ Results: 4.8x concurrent write advantage, 4.56M ops/sec @ 16 threads, 6.51M read-heavy

## Phase 2: Production Error Handling Audit

**Objective:** Ensure Manifold handles all error conditions gracefully and provides clear recovery paths for production deployments.

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

### Tasks

- [x] **2.1: Storage backend error handling**
  - Test behavior when OPFS runs out of quota (WASM)
  - Test behavior when filesystem is full (native)
  - Test read/write errors from corrupted files
  - Test behavior when storage backend becomes unavailable
  - Ensure all errors propagate with clear context
  - **Dev Notes:** Created tests/storage_backend_error_tests.rs with 10 tests covering corruption, permissions, concurrent stress, large allocations. Error context verified adequate.

- [x] **2.2: WAL error handling**
  - Test checkpoint failure mid-operation
  - Test WAL file corruption scenarios
  - Test recovery from partial WAL entries
  - Test behavior when WAL file is deleted during operation
  - Ensure WAL replay handles all edge cases
  - **Dev Notes:** Created tests/wal_error_handling_tests.rs with 12 tests. Fixed eprintln! in journal.rs:378 and checkpoint.rs:193 - replaced with log::warn!/log::error!. WAL CRC mismatch now logs offset and checksums.

- [x] **2.3: Concurrent access error handling**
  - Test deadlock detection (shouldn't happen, verify)
  - Test behavior under extreme contention
  - Test proper cleanup on transaction abort
  - Test recovery from panics during write transactions
  - Ensure lock poisoning is handled correctly
  - **Dev Notes:** Created tests/concurrent_access_error_tests.rs with 9 tests. No deadlocks observed under any scenario (16+ threads). Panic recovery verified. Lock poisoning handled gracefully.

- [x] **2.4: Memory pressure handling**
  - Test behavior when allocations fail
  - Test large value handling (> available RAM)
  - Test cache eviction under memory pressure
  - Monitor and document memory usage patterns
  - Ensure no memory leaks under stress
  - **Dev Notes:** Created tests/memory_pressure_tests.rs with 11 tests covering large values, progressive size increases, concurrent pressure, allocation churn, cache behavior. No leaks detected under stress.

- [x] **2.5: Header corruption handling**
  - Test master header corruption detection
  - Test column family metadata corruption recovery
  - Test CRC validation on all critical structures
  - Ensure clear error messages for corruption scenarios
  - Document recovery procedures
  - **Dev Notes:** Added CRC32 checksum to master header (last 4 bytes). Modified header.rs to_bytes() to compute/append CRC, from_bytes() to validate BEFORE parsing. Created tests/header_corruption_tests.rs with 12 tests covering magic number corruption, CRC mismatch, truncation, UTF-8 errors, clear error messages. All corruption scenarios now detected at open-time.

- [x] **2.6: Graceful shutdown**
  - ✅ Test clean shutdown under active writes
  - ✅ Test WAL checkpoint on process termination
  - ✅ Test WASM beforeunload handler integration
  - ✅ Ensure no data loss on normal shutdown
  - ✅ Test recovery from abnormal shutdown
  - **Dev Notes:** Created tests/graceful_shutdown_tests.rs with 12 tests. **All 11 active tests passing.**
  
  **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** WAL entries were being written with DEFERRED checksums (value 999).
  - Root cause: WAL entry created BEFORE system table checksums finalized
  - Fix: Restructured commit_inner() with prepare_system_root_for_durable_commit() and prepare_system_root_for_non_durable_commit() helpers
  - WAL now always written with finalized checksums ✅
  
  **SECONDARY ISSUES FIXED:** Two architectural bugs discovered and resolved:
  
  1. **Stale in-memory Database state after WAL recovery**
     - Issue: Database instances created during recovery had stale TableTree metadata
     - Impact: "Table not found" errors after reopening
  
  2. **Database::drop cleanup corruption**
     - Issue: Database::drop's ensure_allocator_state_table_and_trim() overwrote correct recovery headers
     - Impact: Recovery succeeded but was immediately corrupted by cleanup commit
  
  **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:** WAL recovery using ManuallyDrop<Database>
  - Created perform_wal_recovery() function in column_family/database.rs
  - Uses Database instances for proper initialization (allocator state, repair)
  - Wraps instances in ManuallyDrop to prevent Drop::drop from running
  - No cached instances during recovery → no stale state
  - No Drop cleanup → no corruption
  - Clean, production-ready solution using standard Rust patterns
  
  **Files Changed:**
  - src/column_family/database.rs: Added perform_wal_recovery() with ManuallyDrop
  - src/transactions.rs: Added prepare_system_root helpers, reordered commit flow
  - src/tree_store/page_store/page_manager.rs: Added apply_wal_transaction() method
  - src/db.rs: Made get_allocator_state_table() pub(crate)
  
  **Performance:** Zero regression - ManuallyDrop is zero-cost, recovery only at open
  - WAL: 249.6K ops/sec at 8 threads
  - Recovery: 296.7K entries/sec (fast and reliable)
  - Read peak: 7.04M ops/sec
  - Mixed workload: 4.58M ops/sec at 16 threads
  
  **Tests:** ✅ 11/11 graceful shutdown tests passing (1 ignored, unrelated)

    - I/O and storage errors (disk full, permissions, file limits, value too large)
    - Corruption detection and recovery procedures
    - Column family errors (not found, already exists)
    - WASM-specific errors (OPFS support, Web Worker requirements, quota)
    - Performance troubleshooting (slow writes/reads, high memory usage)
  
  **Code Quality:**
  - Fixed all pre-existing clippy warnings in test files

## Phase 5: Domain-Specific Optimizations (Future)

**Objective:** Build specialized table types and helper APIs for common workloads without compromising Manifold's general-purpose nature.

**Status:** Deferred until Phases 1-4 complete

### 5.1: Vector Table Optimization

**Concept:** Helper API for storing and querying vector embeddings within column families.

**Design:**
- `VectorTable<const DIM: usize>` - typed wrapper for fixed-dimension vectors
- Zero-copy access via `fixed_width()` trait
- Batch insert optimized for bulk embedding storage
- Integration with external vector index libraries (HNSW, IVF-PQ)
- Support dense, sparse, and multi-vector formats

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "news_articles"
├── Table: "articles"        (String → Article)
├── Table: "vectors_dense"   (VectorTable<768> → [f32; 768])
├── Table: "vectors_sparse"  (String → SparseVector)
└── Table: "metadata"        (String → Metadata)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-vectors` depending on `manifold`

### 5.2: Graph Table Optimization

**Concept:** Efficient edge storage with composite keys for graph workloads.

**Design:**
- Composite key format: `{source}|{edge_type}|{target}`
- Bidirectional edges via separate reverse table
- Range queries for "all edges from vertex X"
- Batch edge insertion via transaction groups
- Integration with graph algorithms

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "social_graph"
├── Table: "edges_forward"   (CompositeKey → EdgeData)
├── Table: "edges_reverse"   (CompositeKey → EdgeData)
├── Table: "vertices"        (String → VertexData)
└── Table: "properties"      (String → Property)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-graph` depending on `manifold`

### 5.3: Time Series Table Optimization

**Concept:** Timestamp-prefixed keys with downsampling support.

**Design:**
- Key format: `{timestamp}|{series_id}`
- Multiple tables for different granularities (raw, minute, hour, day)
- Automatic downsampling via background task
- Efficient range queries by timestamp
- Retention policy support

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "metrics"
├── Table: "raw"             ({timestamp}|{series} → Value)
├── Table: "minute"          ({timestamp}|{series} → Aggregate)
├── Table: "hour"            ({timestamp}|{series} → Aggregate)
└── Table: "metadata"        (String → SeriesMetadata)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-timeseries` depending on `manifold`

### 5.4: Hyperbolic Space Optimization

**Design:**
- Fixed-width storage for N-dimensional hyperbolic coordinates
- Custom distance functions (hyperbolic distance, not Euclidean)
- Spatial index structure preserving hyperbolic properties
- Integration with hyperbolic geometry libraries
- Support for Poincaré disk and hyperboloid models

**Architecture:**
```
Column Family: "hyperbolic_embeddings"
├── Table: "coordinates"     (ID → [f64; 17])
├── Table: "spatial_index"   (HyperbolicKey → BucketData)
└── Table: "metadata"        (ID → Metadata)
```

**Implementation:** Separate crate `manifold-hyperbolic` depending on `manifold`

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Keep Manifold general-purpose** - no specialized types in core
2. **Build domain layers as separate crates** - optional dependencies
3. **Use trait-based abstractions** - `VectorStore`, `GraphStore`, etc.
4. **Compose within column families** - multiple tables per logical collection
5. **Provide examples** - show integration patterns clearly

**Timeline:** Start after benchmarking, error handling, and API polish complete
